# 🎬 DQN Agent GIF Generation Guide

This guide explains how to generate animated GIFs showing your trained DQN agent navigating the FrozenLake environment.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have `pillow` installed for GIF creation:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## 🚀 Method 1: Automatic GIF Generation (Recommended)

The easiest way is to let `dqn_agent.py` generate the GIF automatically when creating results.

### Run the main script:

```bash
python dqn_agent.py
```

After training completes, the results folder will contain:
- `training_progress.png` - Training metrics
- `learned_policy.png` - Policy visualization  
- `training_summary.txt` - Detailed statistics
- `agent_navigation.gif` - **Animated agent navigation** ✨

The GIF is generated by default! If you don't want it, you can disable it programmatically:

```python
agent.generate_results_folder(include_gif=False)
```

## 🎨 Method 2: Standalone GIF Generator

Use the standalone script to generate GIFs from already trained agents:

```bash
python create_gif_from_trained_agent.py --demo
```

Or use it programmatically:

```python
from create_gif_from_trained_agent import create_navigation_gif
from dqn_agent import DQNAgent

# Train agent
agent = DQNAgent()
agent.train(num_episodes=1000)

# Generate GIF
create_navigation_gif(agent, save_folder='my_results', num_episodes=5, fps=2)
```

## 🎮 Method 3: Full Control with generate_agent_gif.py

For complete control over the GIF generation process:

```bash
python generate_agent_gif.py
```

This script provides options to:
- Choose environment size (3x3, 5x5, 8x8, or custom)
- Set training parameters
- Customize GIF settings (number of episodes, FPS)

## ⚙️ Customization Options

### Number of Episodes in GIF

Show more or fewer episodes:

```python
agent._generate_navigation_gif(
    save_path='agent.gif',
    num_episodes=10,  # Show 10 episodes
    fps=2
)
```

### Animation Speed

Control playback speed:

```python
agent._generate_navigation_gif(
    save_path='agent.gif',
    num_episodes=5,
    fps=4  # Faster animation (4 frames per second)
)
```

## 🎯 What the GIF Shows

The animated GIF displays:
- **Grid environment** with colored cells:
  - 🟢 Green = START position
  - 🟡 Gold = GOAL position
  - 🔴 Red = HOLE (deadly)
  - 🔵 Blue = FROZEN (safe)
- **Agent** represented as 🤖
- **Action arrows** showing the agent's movement direction
- **Episode progress** and step counter
- **Success/failure** indicators

## 📝 Example Output

After running any of the methods above, you'll find your GIF in the results folder:

```
dqn_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── training_progress.png
├── learned_policy.png
├── training_summary.txt
└── agent_navigation.gif  ← Your animated GIF!
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'PIL'"
Install pillow:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

### GIF generation is slow
This is normal! Creating animated GIFs can take 30-60 seconds. Be patient.

### Want a faster GIF?
Reduce the number of episodes:
```python
create_navigation_gif(agent, num_episodes=3, fps=3)
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Quick testing**: Use a 3x3 environment for fast training and testing
2. **Better visualization**: Use `fps=2` for slower, easier-to-watch animations
3. **Production**: Use `fps=3-4` for more compact GIFs
4. **Show progress**: The GIF includes multiple episodes to show consistency

## 🎉 Enjoy!

Your GIF will show the agent's learned behavior, making it easy to:
- Share your results
- Debug agent behavior
- Create presentations
- Document your experiments

Happy reinforcement learning! 🤖🎮
